# Machine-learning

Challenge one: supervised learning (logistic regression, Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net, decision tree using ID3 algorithm, Naive Bayes and k-nearest neighbors) and unsupervised learning (PCA, k-means, t-sne and DBSCAN).

Challenge two: linear, polynomial and gaussian kernel methods applied to Ridge regression; linear, polynomial and RBF kernel applied to PCA; SVM model to solve binary classification problem

Challenge three: FCNN and CNN with different number of hidden layers for handwritten symbols (Japanese hiragana) classification problem (KMNIST dataset)
